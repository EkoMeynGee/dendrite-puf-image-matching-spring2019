##### salt & pepper matching rate plot

##Problem

1. ~~the output image is not the same scale as the original pixel image.~~

```matlab
I = data.pic;
imwrite(I, 'name.tif')
```



2. ~~cannot find the middle circle~~

   1. Imfindcircles method ==-----NOT WORKING-------==

      ```matlab
      imfindcircles(I, [rangeA rangeB]);
      ```

   2. Imfill method

   3. ```python
      imfill(I, 'holes');
      ```

   4. Hough Transformation  ==———WORKS————==

3. Not sure which distance is better

   1. the distance between the parents and that node
   2. the distance between each node and the middle circle

4. ~~the method findInitialDots has issue with rough image~~

5. ~~find some nodes have mutiple parents problem~~

   1. Really few condition, could be fixed by improving finding nodes method
   2. picRef5 index3 (354, 394),has two parents index8 index9 (356, 390)
   3. Finally, find the problem is that the ==Newpoints== structure does not initialize in the recursive loop.

6. ~~add de-noise method~~

   1. for now, just tried ==gaussian noise== and ==salt & pepper noise==
   2. And just use really simple denoise method

7. ~~Fix the problem of initial circle is not accurate in ==graph_based_Rd function==~~





# Work-Log_March-26-2019

### Problems

- How to make two actually similar picture, one is the denoised image, which lost some node details; other one is the reference image. but they are looks really similar from a person visual point.
- Add some scratches. Any method can denoise the scratches? does that change too much structure of tree.
- how is similarity of scratch noise
- ~~see if I can denoise the salt and pepper noise in a hard way, ==Not work==~~
- Root finding accuracy checker, and how to solve it 
- hough_circle function works better when the radius_descent set to **0.5**
